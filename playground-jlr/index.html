<h2> Reflection </h2>

<p>
For me I found the use of Bootstrap and Animate.css in this assignment was kind of mixed. I feel like it helped in some ways<br>
but I feel I was more confused than usual and needed help from Chat or Online Webpages to get the page to do what I wanted.<br>
I guess that with more time and patience I may have been able to learn the language better.<br>
Animate.css was very easy and helpful in making the cool animations on the website. I liked that.<br>
I think it's more bootstrap. If I were just trying to make a normal website then I feel bootstrap would be useful.<br>
I have found through this website, and the last few, that I am starting to loose my touch. I don't know if it's because I <br>
haven't been coding as much or that I feel stressed with due dates, but I feel like I can't code. <br>
I have lost most if all of the ability to use JavaScript, and that started once I started to get confused in that class.<br>
I think that is where it all went bad actually. Mid-mult last block. I started to become more and more confused, and terms used in class<br>
started to sound like another language. I was pretty confident when I started this course that I could learn the ability to code. <br>
Now Im not so confident. I guess Im just dissapointed in myself. I so wanted this to be a carrer option, but I worry I may<br>
not have what it takes. I do know HTML pretty good and Css alright but my Java Scripting is starting to make me slip. <br>
I think this assignment has taught me a lot about myself. I feel more nervous and afraid of the future of my IDT experience<br>
with coding as it gets more and more complex. I pray that I may be able to pick it back up.<br>
The only time I fully understand it is when Geremy is doing it on the board.<br>
<br>
Again, I did this website. I made it. But I had to have chat correct my code countless times and provide me suggestions of how to handle things.<br>
