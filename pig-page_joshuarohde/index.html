        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Pigs, often underestimated in their complexity and significance, hold a multifaceted role in human society that extends far beyond their portrayal as mere livestock. Revered for their intelligence, social behaviors, and adaptability, pigs serve as a compelling subject for exploration into the intricate relationship between humans and animals.</p>

            <p class="text-start lead">Pigs, known scientifically as Sus scrofa domesticus, are highly intelligent and social animals that have been domesticated for thousands of years. They are omnivorous mammals belonging to the Suidae family. Pigs are renowned for their remarkable sense of smell, which is far more developed than that of humans, and they use it for foraging food. Despite the common misconception of pigs being dirty animals, they are actually quite clean and will designate specific areas within their habitat for waste disposal. Additionally, pigs are highly adaptable creatures, thriving in a variety of environments, from dense forests to agricultural landscapes. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), pigs play a significant role in agriculture, providing meat products consumed worldwide, with China being the largest producer of pork. Furthermore, research published in the journal Animal Welfare affirms pigs' complex cognitive abilities, demonstrating their capacity for problem-solving and social interaction.</p>

  <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold text-body-emphasis">HEAR THEM OINK!</h1>
  <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
    <p class="lead mb-4">Pigs, like many animals, have a wide range of vocalizations they use to communicate with each other. While it might sound like all oinks are the same to us, researchers have found that pigs can actually produce a variety of distinct sounds, each with its own meaning or purpose. These sounds can convey different emotions, intentions, or needs within the social dynamics of a pig group.</p>
